      <p class="career-par">The Cognitive Science Student Association was established to build and maintain a community of students with interest in the multidisciplinary aspects of Cognitive Science. We maintain a strong relationship with UCSD's prestigious Cognitive Science Department in order to deliver academic opportunities to our members and stay up-to-date with the most cutting edge research in Cognitive Science. We establish connections with professional groups in the San Diego area in order to help our members discover the multidisciplinary qualifications that Cognitive Science offers to the professional world.</br></br>
      Our events, meetings, outings, and easy-going atmosphere promote a close-knit community and provide invaluable services and opportunities to anyone who is interested in becoming an active member of CSSA.</p>
