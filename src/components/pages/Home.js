                            </p>
                            <p>As students of one of the first cognitive science departments 
                                in the nation, our mission is to highlight the intersectional 
                                nature of our industry through a space that connects 
                                renowned professors with the growing student body.

                                alone. We recognize the value of learning not just by ourselves, 
                                but with and from each other.

                                piece by piece through workshops, internship and research 
                                opportunities, career-based speaker series, and a yearly
