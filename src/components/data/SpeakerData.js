Her areas of interest include neuroscience, psycholinguistics, speech and language disorders, and brain plasticity. She uses different electrophysiology (surface and intracranial electroencephalography and electromyography) and brain imaging methods to study the brain dynamics of control processes in language production in healthy and impaired speakers. Her work seeks to shed light on how the brain reorganizes in populations with brain disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and brain tumors, and how cognitive control processes are engaged in compensatory processes for language recovery.",

How do such cognitive tools support humans in making efficient use of their limited cognitive capacities on hard computational problems such as planning? Felix researches the computational nature of such tools using agent-based simulations. This research—best described as computational cognitive science—aims to shed light on how humans achieve so much from so limited cognitive resources.",
