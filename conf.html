    <h1 class="about-title">About</h1>
      <p class="about-para">Welcome to UC San Diego Cognitive Science Student Association's 12th annual Cognitive Science Conference! Based on the theoretical framework of the 1950’s Cognitive Revolution, this year’s National Cognitive Science Conference aims to explore the rising popularity of its practical applications. These applications represent two core values — innovation and inclusivity. With today’s tech boom, we innovate by optimizing creation, expediting the software development process, and spurring medical advances. And with growing awareness, we include others by overcoming cognitive biases and helping those who are disabled or in need. Our conference hopes to encompass these two topics in what we call a new frontier - the Cognitive Revolution 2.0. Join us for a packed day of engaging presentations, interactive workshops, invaluable
      networking, and free food! </p>

            <h2> Jillian Lee Wiggins</h2>
            <p>Talk Title: “Uncovering the brain mechanisms of risk and resilience: Social and emotional functioning in children with mental health disorders”
             Bio: Jillian Lee Wiggins, Ph.D. is a developmental psychologist who received her Ph.D. from University of Michigan in 2013. At the University of Michigan, Dr. Wiggins’ research focused on identifying the brain and genetic mechanisms of socio-emotional functioning (for example, social interaction with other people, reading people’s emotions, reacting to people’s facial expressions) in youth with autism spectrum disorder as well as typically developing youth. To do this, she used neuroscience tools (functional MRI, functional connectivity, genotyping) to link brain activation patterns in response to emotional faces to genetic variation in children and adolescents with and without autism. After completing her PhD, Dr. Wiggins joined the Emotion and Development Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health/National Institutes of Health (NIMH/NIH) as a post-doctoral fellow. At the NIH, Dr. Wiggins’ work examined brain mechanisms of processing socio-emotional stimuli (i.e., faces) in youth with severe irritability and bipolar disorder.
