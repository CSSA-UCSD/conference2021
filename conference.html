    <h1 class="about-title">About</h1>
      <p class="about-para">Welcome to UC San Diego Cognitive Science Student Association's 12th annual Cognitive Science Conference! Based on the theoretical framework of the 1950’s Cognitive Revolution, this year’s National Cognitive Science Conference aims to explore the rising popularity of its practical applications. These applications represent two core values — innovation and inclusivity. With today’s tech boom, we innovate by optimizing creation, expediting the software development process, and spurring medical advances. And with growing awareness, we include others by overcoming cognitive biases and helping those who are disabled or in need. Our conference hopes to encompass these two topics in what we call a new frontier - the <strong>Cognitive Revolution 2.0</strong>.

            <h2>Michael Aribib</h2>
            <p> Michael A. Arbib has held Emeritus status (since August 2016) as University Professor, Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, as well as a Professor of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Southern California, which he joined in September of 1986. He is currently an Adjunct Professor of Psychology at the University of California at San Diego. The thrust of his work is expressed in the title of his first book, Brains, Machines and Mathematics (McGraw-Hill, 1964): the brain is not a computer in the current technological sense, but he has based his career on the argument that we can learn much about machines from studying brains, and much about brains from studying machines.

            <h2>Douglas Nitz</h2>
            <p> Douglas A. Nitz grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio and earned his Bachelor of Science at the University of Cincinnati. It's here that he fell in love with neuroscience, having been given a great opportunity to work with brain stimulation reward with Robert Frank. He worked for a year or so as a sleep disorders technician after his undergraduate training was complete, participating in a number of studies testing new sleep-inducing compounds, treating sleep apnea patients, and testing the effects of potential treatments for narcolepsy. In the fall of 1988, he left for UCLA's Neuroscience PhD program as part of the Basic Sleep Research Training Program. During this time, he continued to work in sleep disorders clinics while working on my doctoral thesis work in the laboratory of Jerome Siegel, discoverer of the proximal cause of narcolepsy in humans. Through the work in the Siegel laboratory and the training program, he was exposed to and participated in an abundance of systems neuroscience problems where understanding interactions among multiple brain regions is key. He finished his PhD in the spring of 1995 and took a post-doctoral position with Bruce McNaughton at the University of Arizona. There, he learned to apply the neuroscience methodology, recording of multiple single neurons in behaving animals, that still dominates his work today and which, for him, is the most revealing of brain function as it relates to information processing. The work there stoked his interest in spatial cognition which remains the focus of his research program today. From there, he did a short stint recording hippocampal neurons in homing pigeons with Vern Bingman at Bowling Green State University. By the fall of 1998, he signed on to work at The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego with Giulio Tononi and Gerald Edelman. It's here that he was afforded his first opportunity to run his own small laboratory as a senior fellow and also where he began work on cortical representation of spatial information. Ten years later, he found a research professor position with the Cognitive Science Department at UCSD. He reports that the research and teaching at UCSD have been very rewarding and being in cognitive science gives one valuable exposure to multiple different perspectives on 'science'.

She conducted her postdoctoral work in the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, based at Boston University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she investigated the rhythmic coordination of neural spiking activity in the rodent hippocampus. In 2015, she became a UC Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSD, and began investigating the relationship between local circuit level processes in the brain and extracranially measured brain rhythms. Her research tests whether rhythmic activity is important for coordinating the processing of information in organized networks of neurons. Her goal is to provide new insight into the single cell interactions underlying the occurrence of brain rhythms measured in rodents and humans</p>

            <h2>Christine Johnson</h2>
            <p> Christine Johnson is a researcher and professor at the University of California's Cognitive Science department. Her primary interest is in the evolution of social cognition and in taking a comparative approach to its study. In her lab, she does observational analyses of real-world interactions between socially sophisticated animals, including dolphins, bonobos, elephants and humans. These multi-scalar analyses include moment-by-moment video and audio analyses, situated within longer term behavioral patterns. By applying a model of "Distributed Cognition"* to such interactions, she aims to understand the media of information flow in these engagements, and the constraints on behavioral co-regulation in these dynamic systems.

            <h2> Jillian Lee Wiggins</h2>
            <p>Talk Title: “Uncovering the brain mechanisms of risk and resilience: Social and emotional functioning in children with mental health disorders”
             Bio: Jillian Lee Wiggins, Ph.D. is a developmental psychologist who received her Ph.D. from University of Michigan in 2013. At the University of Michigan, Dr. Wiggins’ research focused on identifying the brain and genetic mechanisms of socio-emotional functioning (for example, social interaction with other people, reading people’s emotions, reacting to people’s facial expressions) in youth with autism spectrum disorder as well as typically developing youth. To do this, she used neuroscience tools (functional MRI, functional connectivity, genotyping) to link brain activation patterns in response to emotional faces to genetic variation in children and adolescents with and without autism. After completing her PhD, Dr. Wiggins joined the Emotion and Development Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health/National Institutes of Health (NIMH/NIH) as a post-doctoral fellow. At the NIH, Dr. Wiggins’ work examined brain mechanisms of processing socio-emotional stimuli (i.e., faces) in youth with severe irritability and bipolar disorder.
